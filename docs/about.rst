Citing AxoPy
============

If you use AxoPy in your research, we'd appreciate it if you could cite our
`JOSS paper`_. Here's a BibTeX entry if that's your style:

.. code-block:: bibtex

    @article{axopy,
        title = {{AxoPy}: A {Python} Library for Implementing Human-Computer Interface
            Experiments},
        author = {Lyons, Kenneth R. and Margolis, Benjamin W. L.},
        journal = {Journal of Open Source Software},
        volume = {4},
        number = {34},
        pages = {1191},
        year = {2019},
        doi = {10.21105/joss.01191}
    }
