class Pipeline(Block):
    """Feedforward arrangement of blocks for processing data.

    A :class:`Pipeline` contains a set of :class:`Block` objects which operate
    on data to produce a final output.

    To create a pipeline, the following two rules are needed: blocks in a list
    processed in series, and blocks in a tuple are processed in parallel.

    Blocks that are arranged to take multiple inputs should expect to take the
    corresponding number of inputs in the order they are given. It is up to the
    user constructing the pipeline to make sure that the arrangement of blocks
    makes sense.

    Parameters
    ----------
    blocks : container
        The blocks in the pipline, with lists processed in series and tuples
        processed in parallel.

    Attributes
    ----------
    named_blocks : dict
        Dictionary of blocks in the pipeline. Keys are the names given to the
        blocks in the pipeline and values are the block objects.
